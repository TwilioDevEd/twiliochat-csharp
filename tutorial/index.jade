      ## Introduction

      Ready to implement a chat application using Twilio IP Messaging Client?

      This application allow users to exchange messages through different channels,
      using the Twilio IP Messaging API. On this example, we'll show how to use 
      this API capabilities to manage channels and their usages.

      ## Token Generation

      In order to create a Twilio IP messaging client, you will need an access
      token. This token holds information about your Twilio Account and IP
      Messaging API keys.

      We generate this token by creating a new `AccessToken` and providing it with
      an `IpMessagingGrant`. With the `AccessToken` at hand, we can use its
      method `ToJWT()` to return its string representation.

        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Controllers/TokenController.cs',
        data-highlight='17-28')
    :markdown
      ## Token Generation Controller

      On our controller we expose the endpoint responsible to provide a valid
      token. Using the information provided as parameters:

      * `device`: identifies the device being used.  
      * `identity`: identifies the user itself.

      It uses `tokenGenerator.Generate` method to get hold of a new token
      and return it in a JSON format to be used for our client.

        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Scripts/twiliochat.js',
        data-highlight='81-88,91-93')
    :markdown
      ## Initializing the IP Messaging Client

      On our client, we fetch a new Token using a POST request to our endpoint.

      And with the token we can instantiate a new `Twilio.AccessManager` that
      it's used to initialize our `Twilio.IPMessaging.Client`.

        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Scripts/twiliochat.js',
        data-highlight='124-131')
    :markdown
      ## Getting the Channel List

      After initializing the client, we can now call it's method `getChannels`
      to retrieve all visible channels. The method returns a promise as a
      result that we use to show the list of channels retrieved on the UI.

        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Scripts/twiliochat.js',
        data-highlight='134-151')
    :markdown
      ## Join the General Channel

      This application will try to join a channel called "General Channel" when it starts.
      If the channel doesn't exist, we'll create one with that name. The scope of
      this example application will show you how to work only with public channels,
      but the IP Messaging client allows you to create private channels and handle
      invitations.

      Notice we set a unique name for the general channel as we don't want to
      create a new general channel every time we start the application.

  .step(data-title='Listen to Channel Events',
        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Scripts/twiliochat.js',
        data-highlight='161-165')
    :markdown
      ## Listen to Channel Events

      With access to the channel objects we can use them to listen to
      a series of events. In our case, we're setting listeners to the
      following events:

      * `messageAdded`: When another member sends a message to the channel you are connected to.
      * `typingStarted`: When another member is typing a message on the channel that you are connected to.
      * `typingEnded`: When another member stops typing a message on the channel that you are connected to.
      * `memberJoined`: When another member joins the channel that you are connected to.
      * `memberLeft`: When another member leaves the channel that you are connected to.

      We register a different function to handle each particular event.

    :markdown
      ## Listen to Client Events

      Just like with channels, we can register handlers for events on the Client:

      * `channelAdded`: When a channel becomes visible to the Client.
      * `channelRemoved`: When a channel is no longer visible to the Client.
      * `tokenExpired`: When the supplied token expires.

        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Scripts/twiliochat.js',
        data-highlight='60-68')
    :markdown
      ## Creating a Channel

      To create a new channel, the user clicks on the "+ Channel" link. That we'll show
      an input text field where it's possible to type the name of the new channel.
      The only restriction here, is that the user can't create a channel called
      "General Channel". Other than that, creating a channel is as simple as calling
      `createChannel` with an object that has the `friendlyName` key. You can create a channel
      with more options though, see a list of the options
      [here](//media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/rtc/js/ip-messaging/releases/0.9.2/docs/api/Client.html#createChannel).

        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Scripts/twiliochat.js',
        data-highlight='300-310')
    :markdown
      ## Joining Other Channels

      When you tap on the name of a channel from the sidebar, that channel is set
      as the `selectedChannel`. The `selectChannel` method takes care of joining
      to the selected channel and setting up the `selectedChannel`.

  .step(data-title='Deleting a Channel',
        data-file='TwilioChat.Web/Scripts/twiliochat.js',
        data-highlight='286-298')
    :markdown
      ## Deleting a Channel

      Deleting a channel is even more simple than creating one. The application
      lets the user delete the channel they are currently joined to through the
      "delete current channel" link. The only thing you need to do to
      actually delete the channel from Twilio, is call the `delete` method
      on the channel you are trying to delete. As other methods on the `Channel'
      object, It'll return a promise where you can set function that is going
      to handle successes.
